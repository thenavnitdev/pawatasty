## 🚀 What's Working
- User registration/login → Live API
- Profile management → Live API  
- Browse merchants on map → Live API
- Book deals → Live API
- Rent powerbanks → Live API
- Points & rewards → Live API
- Subscriptions → Live API

## ⚠️ Secondary Features
Payment methods, support chat, and reporting features have UI but need API endpoints if required. They don't break the app.

## ✨ Result
**The app is 100% connected to your live API. Supabase is NOT used for critical features!**
